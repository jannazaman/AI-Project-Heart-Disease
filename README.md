## Key Features
1. Superior Performance of MLP with "tanh" Activation: Based on experiment outcomes, the MLP model with the "tanh" activation function outperformed both linear and non-linear SVM models, achieving the highest accuracy of 0.885. This indicates that the MLP model is a better fit for this dataset and its ability to simulate non-linear correlations contributes to capturing complex data patterns effectively.
   
2. Model Advantages: SVMs excel in handling high-dimensional and non-linearly separable data through kernel functions, offering insights into the decision-making process. On the other hand, MLPs provide greater flexibility, mastering complex mappings. Careful hyperparameter selection is essential to avoid overfitting in MLP, while the symmetric "tanh" activation function aids in better data pattern understanding.
   
## Experience
Optimized Experience: Hands-on expertise with MLP neural networks and SVM models. Explored activation functions (relu, tanh), learning rates (0.01, 0.001), and optimizers for MLPs (SGD, Adam), and different kernel functions for SVMs (linear, rbf, sigmoid). Strengthened capabilities in handling non-linear relationships, intricate data patterns, and classification tasks with powerful machine learning algorithms. Excelled in preprocessing diverse datasets, ensuring clean and transformed data for effective machine learning analysis.
